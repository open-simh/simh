   simulator.  It is required by all modules.


   -----------------------------------------------------
   Implementation Note -- Compiling the Simulator as C++
   -----------------------------------------------------

   Although simulators are written in C, the SIMH project encourages developers
   to compile them with a C++ compiler to obtain the more careful type checking
   provided.  To obtain successful compilations, the simulator must be written
   in the subset of C that is also valid C++.  Using valid C features beyond
   that subset, as the HP 2100 simulator does, will produce C++ compiler errors.

   The standard C features used by the simulator that prevent error-free C++
   compilation are:

    1. Incomplete types.

       In C, mutually recursive type definitions are allowed by the use of
       incomplete type declarations, such as "DEVICE ms_dev;" followed later by
       "DEVICE ms_dev {...};".  Several HP device simulators use this feature to
       place a pointer to the device structure in the "desc" field of an MTAB
       array element, typically when the associated validation or display
       routine handles multiple devices.  As the DEVICE contains a pointer to
       the MTAB array, and an MTAB array element contains a pointer to the
       DEVICE, the definitions are mutually recursive, and incomplete types are
       employed.  C++ does not permit incomplete types.

    2. Implicit conversion of ints to enums.

       In C, enumeration types are compatible with integer types, and its
       members are constants having type "int".  As such, they are semantically
       equivalent to and may be used interchangeably with integers.  For the
       developer, though, C enumerations have some advantages.  In particular,
       the compiler may check a "switch" statement to ensure that all of the
       enumeration cases are covered.  Also, a mathematical set may be modeled
       by an enumeration type with disjoint enumerator values, with the bitwise
       integer OR and AND operators modeling the set union and intersection
       operations.  The latter has direct support in the "gdb" debugger, which
       will display an enumerated type value as a union of the various
       enumerators.  The HP simulator makes extensive use of both features to
       model hardware signal buses (e.g., INBOUND_SET, OUTBOUND_SET) and so
       performs bitwise integer operations on the enumerations to model signal
       assertion and denial.  In C++, implicit conversion from enumerations to
       integers is allowed, but conversion from integers to enumerations is
       illegal without explicit casts.  Therefore, the idiom employed by the
       simulator to assert a signal (e.g., "outbound_signals |= ioIRQ") is
       rejected by the C++ compiler.

    3. Implicit increment operations on enums.

       Because enums are compatible with integers in C, no special enumerator
       increment operator is provided.  To cycle through the range of an
       enumeration type, e.g. in a "for" statement, the standard integer
       increment operator, "++", is used.  In C++, the "++" operator must be
       overloaded with a version specific to the enumeration type; applying the
       integer "++" to an enumeration is illegal.

    4. Use of C++ keywords as variable names.

       C++ reserves a number of additional keywords beyond those reserved by C.
       Use of any of these keywords as a variable or type name is legal C but
       illegal C++.  The HP simulator uses variables named "class" and
       "operator", which are keywords in C++.

   The HP simulator is written in ISO standard C and will compile cleanly with a
   compiler implementing the 1999 C standard.  Compilation as C++ is not a goal
   of the simulator and cannot work, given the incompatibilities listed above.

/* The following pragmas quell clang and Microsoft Visual C++ warnings that are

   symbols that, in my view, make the code harder to read and maintain, I elect

/* Tracing and console output.

   "tprintf" is used to write tracing messages.  It does an "fprintf" to the

   enabled in device "dev".  Otherwise, it's a NOP.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values.

   "tpprintf" is identical to "tprintf", except that a device pointer is passed
   instead of a device structure.

   "TRACING" and "TRACINGP" implement the test conditions for device and device
   pointer tracing, respectively.  They are used explicitly only when several
   trace statements employing the same flag are required, and it is desirable to
   avoid repeating the stream and flag test for each one.

   "cprintf", "cputs", and "cputc" are used to write messages to the console
   and, if console logging is enabled, to the log output stream.  They do
   "(f)printf", "fputs", or "(f)putc", respectively.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values, "str" is the string to write, and "ch" is the
   character to write.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "cputs" macro uses "fputs" for both console and log file output
       because "puts" appends a newline, whereas "fputs" does not.

/* I/O event timing.

   I/O events are scheduled for future service by specifying the desired delay
   in units of event ticks.  Typically, one event tick represents the execution
   of one CPU instruction, and this is the way event ticks are defined in the
   current simulator implementation.  However, the various CPUs themselves not
   only vary in speed, but the actual instruction times vary greatly, due to the
   presence of block move, compare, and scan instructions.  Variations of an
   order of magnitude are common, and two orders or more are possible for longer
   blocks.

   The 24296-90001 Diagnostic Configurator provides a one millisecond timer for
   use by the diagnostic programs.  The timer is a two-instruction software
   loop, plus four instructions of entry/exit overhead, based on the processor
   type.  The values provided are:

             Loop     Instr
     CPU     Count    /msec
     ------  -----    -----
     2114      246      496
     2115      246      496
     2116      309      622
     2100      252      508
     1000-M    203      410
     1000-E   1573 *   1577

     * The E-Series TIMER instruction is used instead of a software loop.  TIMER
       re-executes an internal decrement until the supplied value reaches zero.

   To pass diagnostics that time peripheral operations, the simulator assumes
   the E-Series execution rate for all devices (0.634 microseconds per event
   tick), although this results in needlessly long delays for normal operation.
   A correct implementation would change the timing base depending on the
   currently selected CPU.

   To accommodate possible future variable instruction timing, I/O service
   activation times must not assume a constant 0.634 microseconds per event
   tick.  Delays should be defined in terms of the "uS" (microseconds), "mS"
   (milliseconds), and "S" (seconds) macros below.

/* Architectural data constants.

   These macros specify the width, sign location, value mask, and minimum and
   maximum signed and unsigned values for the data sizes supported by the
   simulator.  In addition, masks for 16-bit and 32-bit overflow are defined (an
   overflow is indicated if the masked bits are not all ones or all zeros).

   The HP_WORD type is used to declare variables that represent 16-bit registers
   or buses in hardware.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The HP_WORD type is a 32-bit unsigned type, instead of the more logical
       16-bit unsigned type.  There are two reasons for this.  First, SCP
       requires that scalars referenced by REG (register) entries be 32 bits in
       size.  Second, IA-32 processors execute instructions with 32-bit operands
       much faster than those with 16-bit operands.

       Using 16-bit operands omits the masking required for 32-bit values.  For
       example, the code generated by gcc for the following operations is as
       follows:

         uint16 a, b, c;
         a = b + c & 0xFFFF;

            movzwl  _b, %eax
            addw    _c, %ax
            movw    %ax, _a

         uint32 x, y, z;
         x = y + z & 0xFFFF;

            movl    _z, %eax
            addl    _y, %eax
            andl    $65535, %eax
            movl    %eax, _x

       However, the first case uses operand override prefixes, which require
       substantially more time to decode (6 clock cycles vs. 1 clock cycle).
       This time outweighs the additional 32-bit AND instruction, which executes
       in 1 clock cycle.

   These macros specify the width, data mask, and maximum unsigned values for
   the implementation of logical and physical addresses.

   HP 21xx and 1000 CPUs address a maximum of 32K words with 15-bit addresses.
   This is the logical address space.  A logical address contains a 5-bit page
   number, designating one of 32 1K-word pages, and a 10-bit offset into that
   page.  1000-series machines may employ an optional Memory Expansion Module to
   map the logical address space anywhere with a 1M-word physical memory on a
   per-page basis.  The MEM translates a logical address to a physical address
   by mapping the 5-bit logical page number to a 10-bit physical page number
   while retaining the logical page offset.  Physical addresses therefore
   support 1024 pages of 1024 words each.

   The logical address form is:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   ...where bit 15 is not used (it is reserved for an indirect address
   indicator).

   The physical address form is:

      19  18  17  16  15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     |              page number              |              page offset              |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The MEMORY_WORD type is used to declare variables that represent 16-bit main
   memory locations in hardware.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The MEMORY_WORD type is a 16-bit unsigned type, corresponding with the
       16-bit main memory in the HP 21xx/1000.  Unlike the general data type,
       which is a 32-bit type for speed, main memory does not benefit from the
       faster 32-bit execution on IA-32 processors, as only one instruction in
       the "mem_read" and "mem_write" routines has an operand override that
       invokes the slower instruction fetch path.  There is a negligible
       difference in the Memory Pattern Test diagnostic execution speeds for the
       uint32 vs. uint16 definition, whereas the VM requirements are doubled for
       the former.

/* CPU instruction symbolic source.

   The memory-reference group (MRG) instructions do not specify full logical
   addresses of their targets.  Instead, they specify offsets from either the
   base page or the current page.  Instructions specifying base-page offsets are
   always displayed with target addresses between 0000-1777.  The display and
   parsing of instructions specifying current-page offsets depends on the source
   of the instructions.

   If the current-page CPU instruction is contained in main memory, the current
   page is taken from the address of the word containing the instruction, and
   the full target address between 00000-77777 is displayed or parsed.  However,
   if the instruction is contained in a device buffer, e.g., a disc drive sector
   buffer, the destination memory address is unknown until the instruction is
   transferred to memory.  In this case, the target address is displayed or
   parsed as the offset prefixed with the letter "C" (e.g., "LDA C 1200").  In
   order to present the proper symbolic behavior, the mnemonic formatter and
   parser must know the source of the request.

   Additionally, display requests from the EXAMINE command have preloaded a
   value array with the maximum number of words required to encode the longest
   instruction.  This is inefficient, as only a fraction of the instruction set
   requires more than one word.  For EXAMINE commands entered by the user at the
   SCP prompt, this is unimportant.  However, for calls from the CPU instruction
   trace routine, the overhead is significant.  In the latter case, the array is
   loaded only with a single word, and the mnemonic formatter loads additional
   words if the specific instruction to be displayed requires them.

/* CPU configuration.

   The CPU exports a "cpu_configuration" word that indicates the current
   CPU model and firmware option configuration.  It is used by the
   symbolic examine and deposit routines and instruction tracing to
   determine whether the firmware implementing a given opcode is
   present.  It is a copy of the CPU unit option flags with the encoded
   CPU model decoded into individual model flag bits.  This allows a
   simple (and fast) AND operation with a firmware feature word to
   determine applicability, saving the multiple masks and comparisons
   that would otherwise be required.

   Additionally, the configuration word has the unit CPU model bits set
   on permanently to permit a base-set feature test for those CPUs that
   have no options currently enabled (at least one non-option bit must
   be on for the test to succeed, and the model bits are not otherwise
   used).
